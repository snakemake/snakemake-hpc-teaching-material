#TASK: see below the samtools_sort-rule

rule bwa_map:
    input:

# Task: Complement the following rule
#
#  - its input stems from the bwa_map-rule
#  - be sure to use the {sample} wildcard, too
#  - its output should go into a
#    'sorted_reads' directory.
#
# Note: Do you see 'wildcards.sample' in the shell-directive?
#
# We need this, because wildcards by name are available in the 'in-'
# and 'output' directives. Effectively, wildcards are regular expressions
# in the form '.+' and stored internally as named lists.
