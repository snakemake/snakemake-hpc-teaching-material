# Resource configuration for bioinformatics workflow on Mogon NHR
# 
# This file defines resource allocations for various bioinformatics tools.
# Adjust these settings based on your specific dataset characteristics:
# - Input file sizes
# - Genome complexity
# - Coverage depth
# 
# Remember to monitor job performance and adjust resources as needed.

default-resources:
  slurm_partition=intelsr_devel

set-resources:
        bwa_map:
           runtime: 5 # Adjust based on your dataset size. Typical range: 30-120 minutes
           mem_mb_per_cpu: 1800 # Increase for larger datasets, e.g., 3600 for 30x coverage
    
    samtools_sort:
        runtime: 5 # Adjust based on your dataset size. Typical range: 20-60 minutes
        mem_mb_per_cpu: 3600 # Sorting requires more memory. Increase for larger datasets

    samtools_index:
        runtime: 2 # Indexing is usually quick. Adjust if needed for very large files
        mem_mb_per_cpu: 1800 # Indexing typically requires less memory than sorting

    bcftools_call:
        runtime: 15 # Variant calling can be time-consuming. Adjust based on genome size and coverage
        mem_mb_per_cpu: 2400 # Increase for larger genomes or higher coverage datasets
