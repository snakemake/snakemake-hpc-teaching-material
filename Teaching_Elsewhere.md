# You need to teach this course on an - unknown - cluster?

## Questionaire

This questionaire helps asking the right questions:

- How does the course room look like?
    - How many seats and PC-screens are available?
    - Is there a "Presenter PC"?
    - Is it possible to plug in a Laptop? HDMI?
    - Describe the "projector situation" (1 or more, need to have a key?).
    - Do you need an adaptor for the projector?
    - Which is the OS for participant PCs?
    - Which is the software to log in? (putty, mobaxterm, powershell or plain ssh via Linux - or a terminal on demand)
    - Is 2FA enforced? Is so: How?
      If no 2FA: Any other security measures to consider?
    - ssh-keys - are they to be prepared?
    - Does the site require and/or provide course accounts?
    - Is it possible to do paired programming?

- Cluster Specialties
    - May the course use shared file space for the setup to be copied to? E.g. a workspace? Which are the quota limitations?
    - Which editors or IDS are provided?
    - Will the course require and / or get a SLURM reservation?
    - How long will the course run (number of days)? (our minimum is 2 days for the creator part and 1/2 day for the user part)
    - Does the cluster provide a scratch file system on compute nodes? If yes: what is the path?
    - Will the admins provide a reservation? A "magnetic" reservation for course accounts is preferred, as then no need to adapt the course material is required.

- Misc
    - Do colleagues on site want to be trained as trainers?
