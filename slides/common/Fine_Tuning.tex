	\frametitle{What is this about?}
	\begin{question}[Questions]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What if I really need to submit \textbf{\textsc many} jobs?
	        \item Will crash the cluster?
	        \item My admins report a slow accounting DB. How do I cope with that?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{question}
	\begin{docs}[Objectives]
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Learning how throttle job submission with \Snakemake{}.
			\item Knowing how to limit the status request from \Snakemake to SLURM.
		\end{enumerate}

	\frametitle{Limiting Job Submission Rates}
	\begin{docs}
		We can limit the number of jobs submitted per second with the \altvberb{--max-jobs-per-second} flag.\newline
		\emph{However}, this is only necessary, when dealing with an enormous load of jobs ($\gg$ 1.000 -- 10.000 jobs)\newline\pause
		The default is 10 per second.
	\end{docs}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ snakemake --max-job-per-second=0.1
   \end{lstlisting}	
   The value may be a fraction (here: 1 job per ten seconds). Or simply
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ snakemake --max-job-per-second=5
   \end{lstlisting}
   which would half the submission rate (5 instead of 10)

	\frametitle{Limiting Job Status Queries}
	\begin{docs}
		The SLURM executor plugin has its own limiter and ensures that the accounting data base is not overwhelmed.\newline
		The \altverb{--max-status-checks-per-second} flag allows us to throttle the number of status queries per second.\newline
		The default is at 10. -- Usefull for local jobs, only.
