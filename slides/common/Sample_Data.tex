  We shall copy a few install scripts (which also will download some sample data).\newline
  Please copy the directory \altverb{<++course.pathtosetup++>}.\newline
  \begin{hint}
  	Remember, to copy an entire directory, you can use:
  	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ cp -r <path> ~/.
  	\end{lstlisting}
    We assume that you are working in your \altverb{HOME}. Then typing the \textasciitilde{} is not necessary.
  \end{hint}
  \pause
  Now, change into the copied directory!
