  \begin{alertblock}{Why we will not go in depth now}
You can learn more about modules in 101-HPC courses. Later, we will learn how to use \Snakemake{} workflows, particularly curated ones, available on the web. We \emph{could} re-write and adapt them for a specific cluster, it is better to only parameterize them and do leave the workflow itself unaltered, portable. This is less cumbersome and as workflow systems, including \Snakemake{}, rely on Conda, we will have an in-depth intro to Conda, instead.
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{alertblock}{Do not mix Conda with Modules}
   Do not mix Conda with module files - particularly, avoid writing \altverb{module load} commands in your \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc} file.\newline
   Whenever your modules or Conda are using conflicting compilers or environments, you might not be able to execute your software or -- \emph{worse} -- will result in funny crashes with apparently no reason.
