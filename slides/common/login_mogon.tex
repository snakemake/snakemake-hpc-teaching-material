				\item The $1^\mathsf{st}$ factor is your account - or better a ssh-key associated with it.
				\item The $2^\mathsf{nd}$ factor is a device attributed to you - via a token on your mobile.

		\begin{quote}
			Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
			Typical applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.
		\end{quote}
	\end{block}
	\pause
	The general command syntax is:
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell,escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
$ ssh [options] [<user>(*@*)]<host>
	\end{lstlisting}
	\vspace{-1em}

		If \altverb{<user>@} is ommitted \altverb{ssh} tries to login in on \altverb{host} with the current username.

	\end{exampleblock}
	\pause
	\begin{exampleblock}{Handling Keys and Passphrases}
		\begin{enumerate}\footnotesize
			\item Either you have a crypto stick (Yubi-key, Nitro-key, etc.) - then you need to transport your stick and remember one PIN.
			\item Or you best use a password manger (e.\,g. \lhref{https://keepass.info/download.html}{keepass (Windows, Linux) or keepass2 (Linux, OSX)} - Linux and OSX users may refer to their respective package managers.)

	We describe the basic login options in our wiki.\newline
	Basically there are three options:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item via \lhref{https://www.putty.org/}{putty} -- a lightweight \texttt{ssh} implementation on Windows (see our \lhref{https://docs.hpc.uni-mainz.de/docs/getting-started/mogon-login/}{wiki})
		\item or \lhref{https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/}{mobaxterm} -- free and commercial implementation of \texttt{ssh} on Windows (see our \lhref{https://docs.hpc.uni-mainz.de/docs/getting-started/mogon-login/}{wiki})
		\item or (since Windows 10) using the PowerShell (see our \lhref{https://docs.hpc.uni-mainz.de/docs/getting-started/mogon-login/}{wiki})
	\end{enumerate}
	Users of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (\lhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux}{WSL}) are able to use \texttt{ssh} natively like Linux users.
	\vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Using Linux-Like Logins}
	\begin{docs}
		Except for \texttt{mobaxterm} and \texttt{putty} all other ssh implementations are like the Linux one:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the \texttt{PowerShell} on Windows has the same look \& feel as on Linux
			\item OSX is a UNIX derivative, anyway. Except for the need to install X11 via \texttt{brew}, everything is the same as for Linux users.
			\item WSL users need admin priviledges to install WSL - ask your local OU admin, if you want to use WSL.
