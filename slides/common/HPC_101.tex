   	  \begin{itemize}
        \item How does ordinary job submission work on a cluster?
        \item How does it work using Snakemake? (Which parameterization is necessary?)

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is a scheduler?}
  On HPC systems you do not \emph{just start}, you need a \emph{``scheduler''}.
  So, what's that?\newline
  A scheduler (or ``batch system'') on a HPC system should\ldots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item provide an interface to help defining workflows and/or job dependencies
  \item enable automatic submission of executions
  \item provide interfaces to monitor the executions
  \item prioritise the execution order of unrelated jobs
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{0.8\linewidth}
      This is an micro-intro to the \slurm batch system.

  How does a scheduler work?
  \pause
  \begin{block}{You tell it\ldots}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item how much memory (RAM, scratch space) your job will need.\pause
    \item how much time you will spend on it.\pause
    \item how many CPUs you will need (and in which combination).\pause
    \item whether you need something special (e.g. a GPU).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \pause \vspace{-0.2cm}
  \begin{exampleblock}{The scheduler will act:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It will queue up your job (and decide when it will start relative to others).\pause
    \item It will decide where your job will run physically (which hosts).\pause
    \item Eventually it will start your job (if everything was correct).
    \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Your first job script}}
  \begin{hint}
  	    From now on, we will be scripting examples (cloze-based). For this you will
        need an editor. If you do not know any other editor, use \texttt{gedit}:
  \end{hint}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell, basicstyle=\scriptsize]
$ # cd into appropriate directory
$ # Start gedit with the command 
$ gedit &
  \end{lstlisting}
  \begin{hint}
  	The \texttt{\&} will put the editor into the background.
  \end{hint}

	Now, thing of your analysis workflow: QC, preprocessing, processing, analysis, post-processing and plotting and \ldots \newline
	\pause
	All this \emph{can} be achieved with SLURM, too all with bash:
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
# First, do some pre-processing for the first job.
...
# Then, submit a job without dependencies.
jid1=$(sbatch ... job1.sh)
# NOTE: ALL 'job*sh' scripts are bash scripts,
#       with more logic than the "hello world" script.		

# Next, do some more logic as pre-processing for the 
# follow-up jobs. ...
# multiple jobs can depend on a single job
jid2=$(sbatch --dependency=afterany:$jid1 ... job2.sh)
jid3=$(sbatch --dependency=afterany:$jid1 ... job3.sh)
	\end{lstlisting}
    etc. can easily be a few thousand lines for \emph{every} workflow.
