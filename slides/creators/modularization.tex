	\begin{question}[Take a guess:]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How big can a workflow be (lines of code)? \pause A few hundred to thousand lines.
		    \item Does it then make sense to keep it all in one file?

    \begin{hint}
    	The ideas behind code modularization are:\newline
    	Increase readability, \pause enable parallel devolpment \pause ease testing and debugging.

	Our Snakefile hardly merits modularization, but we could move all mapping-realted stuff to an extra file, e.\,g.:
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
include: "rules/mapping.smk" # will include this Snakefile
	\end{lstlisting}
    \pause
    \begin{docs}
    	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    		\item we  place our modules into \altverb{rules}
    		\item the suffix \altverb{.smk} is convention, too.
    	\end{itemize}

	Try creating this major Snakefile:

from snakemake.utils import min_version

# which is the current snakemake version?
min_version(<the current snakemake version>)

rule all:

	\Snakemake allows to "borrow" from CWL or Nextflow, too:
