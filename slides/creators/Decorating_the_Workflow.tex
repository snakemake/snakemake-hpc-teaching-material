%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{One more Thing: Input Functions}
	Since we have stored the path to the FASTQ files in the config file, we can also generalize the rule \altverb{bwa_map} to use these paths. This case is different to the rule \altverb{bcftools_call} we modified above. To understand this, it is important to know that \Snakemake{} workflows are executed in three phases.
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item In the \emph{initialization phase}, the files defining the workflow are parsed and all rules are instantiated.
		\item In the \emph{DAG phase}, the directed acyclic dependency graph of all jobs is built by filling wildcards and matching input files to output files.
		\item In the \emph{scheduling phase}, the DAG of jobs is executed, with jobs started according to the available resources.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Input Functions - II}
	\begin{alertblock}{Why we cannot do the same all over the Workflow}
		We cannot determine the FASTQ paths for rule \altverb{bwa_map} from the config file in this phase, \emph{because we donâ€™t even know which jobs will be generated from that rule}. Instead, we need to defer the determination of input files to the DAG phase. This can be achieved by specifying an input function instead of a string as inside of the input directive.
	\end{alertblock}

  \frametitle{Rule Parameters}
  \begin{warning}
  	Frequently, $3^\mathsf{rd}$ party programs cannot be used with their defaults, additional parameters are required.
  \end{warning}
  In our workflow, it is reasonable to annotate aligned reads with so-called read groups, that contain metadata like the sample name. \newline
  To do so, we add to our \altverb{bwa_map}-rule:
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=Plain,basicstyle=\small]
rule bwa_map:
    input:
        "data/genome.fa",
        get_bwa_map_input_fastqs
    output:
        "mapped_reads/{sample}.bam"

  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Rule Parameters II}
  This is usually part of the configuration file(s), too.\newline
  If you put this in your config file (the double \altverb{\\} "escape" to \altverb{\t}):
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
bwa_map:
   rg="@RG\\tID:{sample}\\tSM:{sample}"
  \end{lstlisting}
  and in your code:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
rule bwa_map:
  params:
     @rg=config['bwa_map']['rg']@
  \end{lstlisting}
  You have a configurable workflow! 
  \begin{hint}
  	This is implemented in \altverb{11_Snakefile_rule_params} in your tutorial and solution folder. This should convince you that a configurable workflow is beneficial - in fact \emph{any} software configuration can be stored in a config file.

  \frametitle{Logging}
  \begin{hint}
  	When executing a large workflow, it is usually desirable to store the logging output of each job into a separate file, instead of just printing all logging output to the terminalâ€”when multiple jobs are run in parallel, this would result in chaotic output. - We already observed this!
  \end{hint}
  \pause
  \begin{task}
  	Look into the workflow: Name all rules, which merit gathering logs.
  \end{task}

  \Snakemake{} will
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \item hold track of your job status (frequency of checks can be adjusted)
   \item cancel your jobs, when itself is stopped
   \item track resource consumption (generated with \altverb{--report [FILE]})
   \item with \altverb{-j unlimited} we allow for an unlimited number of spawned jobs!
  \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \begin{warning}
  	"Unlimited" number of jobs may yield in I/O contention and too many calls to check the job status. Use with care for both issues there is a remedy, which we will meet later!
  \end{warning}

  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Running the Worklow as Cluster Jobs}}
  Our workflow is {\tiny tiny}. It does not merit cluster execution. Yet, for the purpose of this course, please run (with \altverb{-F} to \emph{enforce} execution):
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell, basicstyle=\footnotesize]
$ snakemake --executor slurm \
> --default-resources slurm_partition=<++cluster.partition++> \
> <+++ if cluster.account is defined +++>      slurm_account=<++cluster.account++><+++ endif +++> -j unlimited @-F@

  	Observations?

  \frametitle{The Downside of working with Defaults}
  Ok, this should(!) be running, yet you saw warnings. 
  \begin{question}
  	Why will a ``real'' workflow fail with all these default settings?
  \end{question}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}
   \item ``real data'' tend to be different - insufficient memory
   \item ``real runs'' tend to take longer - insufficient wall time
   \item ``real runs'' tend to run into I/O issues - insufficient workflows
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{The \Snakemake{} \texttt{resources} Section}
	\Snakemake{} rules provide an additional \altverb{resources} section:
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
rule <name>:
	...
	resources:
		partition='parallel',
		mem_mb=1800,
		cpus_per_task=4
	\end{lstlisting}
	\begin{hint}
		Note the \textbf{,}!
	\end{hint}
	\pause
	\begin{docs}
		You \emph{may} define \emph{any} resource keyword within any rule.
	\end{docs}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The \Snakemake{} \texttt{resources} Section - its Downside}
	\begin{block}{Every Resource Spec needs a Change per Rule???}
		You might have noticed, this specification per rule is most untidy. \Snakemake's design principle is: ship workflows which run \emph{everywhere} \& \emph{every time}.
		\newline \pause
		Relax: Every bit we can specify:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item in a \altverb{Snakefile},
			\item on the command line,
			\item and re-usable in configuration files!
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Cluster Configuration}
  \begin{hint}
  	Best abstract the configuration for a cluster from the workflow!
  \end{hint}
  In addition to a \altverb{config} directory to hold our samples, \Snakemake{} will accept a directory with profile settings, usually ``\altverb{profile}''.
  \pause
  A profile has to adhere to \lhref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML}{\texttt{YAML}-format} and be named \altverb{config.yaml}. An example for a cluster configuration might look like (sorry, no syntax highlighting available):
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=Plain]
set-resources:
    bwa_map:
        runtime: 5
        mem_mb_per_cpu: 1800
  \end{lstlisting}
  \pause
  
  \Snakemake{} \lhref{https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cluster.htmls}{offers many more cluster configuration details}, we will revisit some during this course.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Cluster Execution \textbf{with} Configuration}}
  Please execute the workflow again, now with 
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell, basicstyle=\footnotesize]
$ # first copy the template profile:
$ cp -r ../tasks/tutorial/profile .
$ # now, the defaults are satisfied
$ snakemake --executor slurm \
> -j unlimited \
> @--workflow-profile ./profile/ -F@
  \end{lstlisting}
  \begin{question}
  	What do you observe? Which rule still provokes a warning?
  \end{question}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Local Rules}
  \begin{hint}[]
  	Some rules do \emph{not} merit cluster execution!
  \end{hint}
  \pause
  As a rule of thumb this (almost) always includes
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item plotting rules
   \item rules which perform downloads
   \item rules which include remote files (e.\,g. to an archive)
  \end{enumerate}
  \pause
  For such a purpose \Snakemake{} offers the \altverb{localrules} directive.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
# its useage is (at or near the top of a Snakefile)
localrules: rule_a, rule_b, rule_c, ...
  \end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Implementing ``\texttt{localrules}''}}
  Please add
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,style=Python]
localrules: plot_quals, plot_positions
  \end{lstlisting}
  at the top of your \Snakemake{} and rerun the workflow on this cluster.
  \pause
  \begin{question}
  	Which is the impact on the overall execution time?
  \end{question}
  \pause
  \begin{hint}
  	Rules which do are not compute intensive are best executed locally. The overhead of submitting a job and waiting for it to finish will not be an issue.
  \end{hint}
