  \frametitle{\Snakemake{} Profiles}
  \begin{hint}
  	Profiles can shorten your command lines and be an easy remedy for the described issues!
  \end{hint}
  \pause
  Two kinds of profiles are supported:
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  	\item A global profile that is defined in a system-wide or user-specific configuration directory (on Linux, this will be \altverb{\~/.config/snakemake} and \altverb{/etc/xdg/snakemake}, you can find the answer for your system via \altverb{snakemake --help}).
  	\item A workflow specific profile that is defined via a flag (\altverb{--workflow-profile}) or searched in a default location (profile/default) in the working directory or next to the \altverb{Snakefile}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Your Profile}
    \begin{onlyenv}<1| handout:0>
      Your first line forces the executor to be set to \slurm - persistently.
      \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
executor: slurm
     \end{lstlisting}
     No more, \altverb{snakemake --executor slurm ...}!
   \end{onlyenv}
   \begin{onlyenv}<2| handout:0>
   	 The next line tells \Snakemake to wait for 5 seconds, if output files are not present (because we are working with parallel file systems). 
   	 \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
executor: slurm
latency-wait: 5
   	 \end{lstlisting}
    \end{onlyenv}
    \begin{onlyenv}<3| handout:0>
      The entire rest, will tell the storage plugin (\altverb{snakemake-storage-plugin-fs}) to stage in to the node-local storage on your cluster, for \emph{every} job and to copy back your results. When dealing with I/O intensive jobs, this can boost your performance tremendously. 
      \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
executor: slurm
latency-wait: 5
default-storage-provider: fs
shared-fs-usage:
  - persistence
  - sources
  - source-cache
remote-job-local-storage-prefix: |
